Change your Bing-search homepage to wallpapers that you really like --- a handy chrome extension

Bing search homepage is interesting, it shows a different background picture everyday.

But it's always mountains, lakes, animals.....YUK!  
And everyone's homepage is the same....UHH...

So I've came up with a handy little chrome extension to make it cool.

It lets you set a theme, for example "Messi".  
And it will search for high quality wallpaper images using Bing-image-search-API.  
And gives you a different Messi wallpaper everyday.

Then feel tired of Messi and want to change the theme to Katy Parry?  
No problem! Just few clicks away !
